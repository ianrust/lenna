lenna
=====

This is a small art project in which I take the classic CV image of lenna (full one, NSFW), and transform it into something reminiscient of a painting of mine.

In a way, this is a program that has been written to make art like mine.

What it is
=====

I'm taking a Canny edge find of the image, lenna.jpg, and displaying it side by side with itself, filtered to look like the following:

Center
=====

Canny Edge find, edges in black, tan background

Left
=====

Canny Edge find, edges in black-tinged green, gaussian blurred, tan backgrounf

Right
=====

Canny Edge find, edges in fluorescent green, half-filled, tan background

Final Product
=====



Building

Usage
=====

To "paint" any image like this, simply run the following command:

lenna xxxx.jpg

where xxxx.jpg is the image in question
